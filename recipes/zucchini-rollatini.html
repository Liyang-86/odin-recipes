        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These zucchini rollatini are ribbons of zucchini, filled with ricotta, mozzarella, and herbs, and baked in marinara sauce, a bit like lasagna roll-ups, but without the pasta.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (12 ounce) zucchinis, sliced lengthwise into 18 (1/8-inch-thick) planks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese, patted dry</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 clove garlic, grated</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded whole milk mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups jarred marinara sauce (such as Raos), divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) with racks in top third and lower third positions.</li>
            <li>Toss zucchini slices with oil and 2 teaspoons salt on 2 large rimmed baking sheets; arrange in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 10 minutes, rotating baking sheets from top to bottom halfway through cook time.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, and let zucchini slices cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir together ricotta, egg, basil, oregano, lemon zest, pepper, garlic, 1 cup of the mozzarella, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Lightly coat a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread 1 cup marinara sauce evenly in the bottom of the baking dish. Gently pat zucchini slices dry with paper towels. Spoon about 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ricotta mixture on 1 end of 1 zucchini slice; roll up, and place roll, seam-side down, into the marinara in the dish. Repeat process with remaining zucchini slices and ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour remaining 1 cup marinara evenly over center of zucchini rolls, leaving roll ends exposed. Sprinkle rolls evenly with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, slightly browned, and zucchini is very tender, about 25 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes. Garnish with basil.</li>
        </ol>
